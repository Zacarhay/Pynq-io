PYNQ is an open-source project from XilinxÂ® that makes it easier to use Xilinx platforms.

Using the Python language and libraries, designers can exploit the benefits of programmable logic and microprocessors to build more capable and exciting electronic systems.

PYNQ can be used with Zynq, Zynq UltraScale+, Zynq RFSoC, Alveo accelerator boards and AWS-F1 to create high performance applications with:

- parallel hardware execution
- high frame-rate video processing
- hardware accelerated algorithms
- real-time signal processing
- high bandwidth IO
- low latency control

PYNQ is intended to be used by a wide range of designers and developers including:

- Software developers who want to take advantage of the capabilities of Xilinx platforms without having to use ASIC-style design tools to design hardware.
- System architects who want an easy software interface and framework for rapid prototyping and development of their Zynq, Alveo and AWS-F1 design.
- Hardware designers who want their designs to be used by the widest possible audience.
